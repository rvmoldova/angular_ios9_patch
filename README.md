# Angular ios9 ui webview patch

##### Just install it via Bower

```
bower install angular_ios9_patch --save
```

 This patch works around iOS9 UIWebView regression that causes infinite digest
 errors in Angular.

 The patch can be applied to Angular 1.2.0 â€“ 1.4.5. Newer versions of Angular
 have the workaround baked in.

 To apply this patch load/bundle this file with your application and add a
 dependency on the "ngIOS9UIWebViewPatch" module to your main app module.

 For example:

 ```
 angular.module('myApp', ['ngRoute'])`
 ```

 becomes

 ```
 angular.module('myApp', ['ngRoute', 'ngIOS9UIWebViewPatch'])
 ```
